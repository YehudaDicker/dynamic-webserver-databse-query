# dynamic-webserver-databse-query
This project creates a dynamic http webserver, over a tcp/ip connection, on which one can query a database of names and messages, 
addded by those with acess to the server. The database can be searched by either name or message, and if nothing is entered in the search,
the entire databse is listed.
